## Features

1. Cache-Aware Prompting:  Modify session.prompt and promptStreaming to check the cache for existing responses based on the input text. If a cached response exists, return it directly. This can improve performance and reduce API costs.  The cache key could be a hash of the input text.  Consider using the src/caching/distributed.js for distributed caching.  Add options to session.prompt and promptStreaming to enable/disable caching and set cache expiration time.

2. Template Integration with Prompting:  As the user suggested, passing an array of strings to session.prompt and promptStreaming could trigger the template system. The src/templates/system.js file provides the necessary functionality.  The first string in the array could be the template name, and the subsequent strings could be variables to apply to the template.

3. Fallback Integration with Templates:  The fallback system could be integrated with the template system to provide default templates for fallback responses. This would allow for more customized and informative fallback messages.

4. Analytics for Caching and Fallback:  Add analytics tracking to the caching and fallback systems to monitor their usage and effectiveness. This data can be used to optimize the systems and identify potential issues.  The src/monitoring/analytics.js file can be used for this purpose.  Track cache hits, misses, and eviction rates.  Track fallback usage by strategy and success rates.

5. Template Validation: Before applying a template, validate the provided variables against a schema. This can prevent errors and ensure that the generated prompt is valid.  The src/templates/validation.js file provides validation functionality.

6. Compression for Caching: Compress cached responses to reduce storage space and improve retrieval speed.  The src/caching/compression.js file provides compression functionality.  Consider the trade-off between compression level and CPU usage.

7. Cache Integration with Composition: Integrate caching at the composition level.  The CompositionBuilder or CompositionChains could have methods to define caching strategies for specific steps or the entire chain. This would allow for more granular control over caching behavior.  For example, a chain could cache the results of expensive operations while skipping caching for steps that generate dynamic content.

8. Fallback Integration with Composition:  Similar to caching, integrate fallback mechanisms at the composition level.  The CompositionBuilder or CompositionChains could have methods to define fallback strategies for specific steps or the entire chain. This would allow for handling errors and failures gracefully within the composition flow.

9. Template Integration with Composition: Allow templates to be used within the composition steps. This would enable dynamic generation of prompts or other inputs based on the data flowing through the chain.

## Actions

This plan outlines the steps to implement the integration points 1-9, anticipating potential ambiguities and conflicts.

1. Cache-Aware Prompting:

 - Steps:
  Modify session.prompt and promptStreaming to accept a cache option (boolean or object with configuration).
  If cache is enabled, generate a cache key (e.g., hash of input text).
  Check the cache (using DistributedCache) for the key.
  If found, return the cached response.
  If not found, proceed with the normal prompt execution.
  Cache the response with the generated key and expiration time (if configured).
 - Challenges:
  Cache key generation: Ensure uniqueness and consistency.
  Cache invalidation: Implement mechanisms to invalidate outdated or irrelevant entries.
  Handling different response types (streaming vs. non-streaming).

2. Template Integration with Prompting:

 - Steps:
  Modify session.prompt and promptStreaming to accept an array of strings as input.
  If the input is an array, treat the first element as the template name and the rest as variables.
  Use TemplateSystem to apply the template with the variables.
  Pass the generated prompt to the underlying language model.
 - Challenges:
  Variable parsing and substitution: Handle different data types and formatting.
  Error handling: Gracefully handle missing templates or invalid variables.
  Integration with existing prompt options.

3. Fallback Integration with Templates:

 - Steps:
  Add a fallbackTemplate option to FallbackSystem.
  If a fallback is triggered, use TemplateSystem to apply the fallbackTemplate with relevant context (e.g., error message).
  Return the generated fallback response.
 - Challenges:
  Defining appropriate fallback templates for different scenarios.
  Passing context information to the template.
  Handling cases where no fallback template is provided.

4. Analytics for Caching and Fallback:

 - Steps:
  Add methods to DistributedCache and FallbackSystem to record relevant events (e.g., cache hit/miss, fallback triggered).
  Use PerformanceAnalytics to track these events and aggregate statistics.
  Expose methods to retrieve and reset analytics data.
 - Challenges:
  Defining relevant metrics and events.
  Ensuring minimal performance overhead for analytics tracking.
  Data storage and retrieval.

5. Template Validation:

 - Steps:
  Define validation schemas for different templates using TemplateValidator.
  Before applying a template, validate the provided variables against the corresponding schema.
  Throw an error or return a validation result if the variables are invalid.
 - Challenges:
Defining comprehensive validation rules.
Handling different data types and validation constraints.
User-friendly error messages.

6. Compression for Caching:

 - Steps:
Modify DistributedCache to use CacheCompression for compressing and decompressing cached responses.
Configure compression level and algorithm.
Handle potential errors during compression/decompression.
 - Challenges:
Performance trade-offs: Balance compression level with CPU usage.
Compatibility with different data types.
Handling large responses.

7. Cache Integration with Composition:

 - Steps:
Add cache options to CompositionBuilder and CompositionChains (similar to session.prompt).
Implement caching logic within the composition execution flow.
Allow caching to be configured at the step level or for the entire chain.
 - Challenges:
Cache key generation for complex compositions.
Handling dependencies between steps and cache invalidation.
Interaction with other composition features (e.g., branching, retry).

8. Fallback Integration with Composition:

 - Steps:
Add fallback options to CompositionBuilder and CompositionChains.
Implement fallback logic within the composition execution flow.
Allow fallback to be configured at the step level or for the entire chain.
 - Challenges:
Defining fallback strategies for different composition scenarios.
Handling errors and exceptions within the composition flow.
Interaction with other composition features.

9. Template Integration with Composition:

 - Steps:
Allow template names to be used as inputs or outputs within composition steps.
Use TemplateSystem to apply templates during composition execution.
Pass template variables through the composition flow.
 - Challenges:
Variable scoping and management within the composition.
Handling template errors within the composition flow.
Integration with other composition features.
