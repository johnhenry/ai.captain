We examined the **tests** in test/
    - test/*

We examined the **docs**
    - readme.md
    - api.md
    - advanced.md

We examined the **sourve**
    - src/*

This is what we found

## Observations

API Documentation vs Implementation Inconsistencies:
    The api.md documents a Session class with specific options for temperature and caching, but the source code's implementation in src/core/session.js isn't visible to verify alignment
    The API docs show TypeScript interfaces, but the codebase is in JavaScript without type definitions

Test Coverage Gaps:
    Tests exist for core functionality (create-window-chain.mjs, session.mjs), but some documented features lack corresponding tests:
    Missing tests for CacheCompression despite being in source
    Missing tests for PerformanceAnalytics features

Documentation Structure Inconsistencies:
readme.md shows different usage patterns than what's in advanced.md
    Some advanced features documented in api.md aren't covered in advanced.md
    Duplicate documentation of validation rules in advanced.md
    Plan: Restructure docs to eliminate duplication and ensure consistent examples

File Organization Inconsistencies:
    Feature Implementation vs Documentation:
    FallbackSystem.js exists in source but has minimal documentation
    TemplateValidator.js is separate in source but mixed into TemplateSystem docs
    Plan: Update documentation to accurately reflect implementation structure

Code Style Inconsistencies:
    Mix of different export styles (named exports vs default exports)
    Inconsistent use of async/await vs promises
    Plan: Establish and enforce consistent code style

We have devised a plan to normalize the repository.
Please make the following changes in small, incremental, targetd steps

# Phase 1: Code Organization
- Implement consistent export pattern
- Add TypeScript definitions to JSDocs
